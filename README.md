# Module 4 Challenge: JavaScript-Quiz

## Description

This challenge is to create a quiz where the timer starts when a user begins the quiz. The timer decreases by 5 seconds for every wrong answer they select. Once a user completes all the questions, the score is saved in local storage so they can see their highscore and retake the quiz again if they want.


## Installation

N/A


## Usage

When a user clicks on the "Start Quiz" button, a countdown timer will automatically begin. The user will have about 30 seconds to complete a 5-question quiz. Each time the user select an incorrect answer, the countdown will subtract 5 seconds. Once the quiz is complete, they will then see their score and can retake the quiz if they want.
